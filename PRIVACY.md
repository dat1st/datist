# Privacy Policy

We value the privacy and security of our users. Our goal is to provide a secure platform for researchers working on browser forensics, while ensuring that their data remains confidential and protected. This Privacy Policy outlines the measures we take to protect your personal information and the data you store on our platform.

## Encryption and Data Security

All data transmitted to and stored on our servers is encrypted client-side, meaning that it is protected from unauthorized access and cannot be viewed by anyone except the user who created it. Our servers do not store the encryption keys, and as a result, we cannot access the contents of the data stored on our platform.

## Data Removal

Users have the ability to remove their data from our servers at any time. Additionally, we have a policy of scrubbing stale data after 30 days to ensure that no sensitive information is left on our servers for an extended period of time.

## Responsibility for Data Safety

We remind our users that they are responsible for keeping their data safe and secure. The use of our platform for any illegal activity is strictly prohibited, and we are not responsible for any unauthorized access or misuse of data. We advise our users to keep their encryption keys safe and secure, as we cannot assist in the recovery of lost or stolen keys.

## Anonymity

We do not store any information related to the researchers, including their names, email addresses, or other personal information. All “user” and “thread” identifiers are anonymous, and we do not store IP addresses, browser meta data, or other information that could be used to identify our users.

## Source Code Auditability

The source code of all components of our project is open-source and available on GitHub for individual auditing. This allows for the transparency and security of our platform to be independently verified by the public.
